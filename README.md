# seisbench-testing
getting familiar with seisbench



## notes
Running on Microsoft Azure Planetary Computer

1. By default when you log in, you're in `/home/jovyan/PlanetaryComputerExamples`, but it's best to work in a separate folder in your home directory because subfolders under the examples can be overwritten.
```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/scottyhq/seisbench-testing
# Navigate in the file browser to seisbench-testing to run notebooks
```

1. conda environments by default do not persist between sessions. That's ok! just recreate it each time.
